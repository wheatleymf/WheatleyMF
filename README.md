# Hi 

You won't find anything useful here, and this profile isn't properly maintained tbh. Most of my work I've done are art and shaders for Small Fish and other s&box communities. If you're a shader noob, go check out my open-source website, I am working on a collection of beginner-friendly tutorials on shaders! :-)
